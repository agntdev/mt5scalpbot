// Keep a LIVE registration (.command / .callbackQuery / …) so this feature is
// never an empty stub. Replace the reply body with real logic + copy; if you
// change the user-facing text, update tests/specs to match EXACTLY.
// Do NOT rewrite src/bot.ts — buildBot() already auto-loads this module.
